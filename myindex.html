								<div class="card-body">
									<p id="agentp">You want to price on value not costs or time.  You should look at how much it's costing your prospect to have this problem and what it would be worth to them to have the problem solved.  You want to make sure that you pick a niche that has a painful problem that people are willing to pay at least $2,000 to solve.  This program shows you exactly how to do that step-by-step.  I strongly advise everyone in my program to never price below $2,000 and I encourage them to charge more than that and many do.
									</p>
									<p id="agentp">As far as repeat clients… most people believe that problems are fixed once and then that's it, but we all know that's not true.  There's no such thing as fixing something once and forgetting about it, as soon as it's fixed you must maintain it to make sure that it doesn't break again.  This is where ongoing monthly retainers can work well, you fix the problem initially and then provide ongoing service from there. I show you exactly how to do this in Week 6 of the training.</p>

									<p>Yes, we can offer you a payment plan so that you can pay this off over time.</p>
									<p id="agentp">
										And if you can't afford a payment plan, I think you would agree that you need this program more than anyone. In fact, some of my most successful clients have had their back against the wall financially when they started (as did I).
									</p>
									<p id="agentp"></p>
										So I want you to eliminate the thought “I can't afford this” and instead replace it with “How can I afford this”
									</p>
									<p id="agentp"></p>
										You need to get creative and think of how you can find the money.  There's Paypal financing, credit cards, loans, parents, friends, family, you could even sell something and use the money from that.  Don't just use that excuse, get creative and start thinking of ways that you can make this work.  With the payment plan we offer you can get started today for just $599.  That's all the money you need to get started right now, today.</p>

It doesn't matter what your schedule is like, if you can set aside at least 2 hours per week you will be able to work your way through it.</p>

								<div class="card-body">
									<p id="agentp">This program shows you how to start your own consulting business by crafting your own offer.  What this means is, we help you pick a niche based on your specific interests, history etc. and then we look into that niche to see what problems people face day-to-day.  Once we find that problem we see if it's possible for us to solve it through consulting services, if it is possible we have a process for quickly acquiring those skills and then being able to offer help to the niche.  So to be clear, we have a proven process for figuring out what people in a specific niche want and then giving it to them, regardless of your skills or previous experience.  So you don't need to worry about what you will be doing for your clients at this stage, we need to pick a niche, find a painful problem and then work through the process properly.  At the right stage we will see if you have the skills needed to solve the problem and if you don't we have a process for quickly acquiring those skills yourself or contracting them out to somebody who does.</p>

									<p id="agentp">This course is for all possible industries and niches.  It's a program that's designed to work for literally anything in the consulting, coaching and service providers space.

We cover literally everything from end to end and it works for any niche/industry.  We have successful students in thousands of different niches and you can see them on our website.  See, if you click on “reviews” and then click on “filters”, you can filter the reviews by their category of niche/industry and look at all our different students.  You can even filter by location, results and stuff too.  As you can see we have over 3,000 reviews and our average rating is 4.85 stars out of 5.  Combined we've estimated our students have made over $400,000,000 from the methods taught in this training program.  It's that powerful.</p>
